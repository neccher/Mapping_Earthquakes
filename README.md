# Mapping_Earthquakes

The Disaster Reporting Network asked for a webpage that allowed users to see magnitude and location of all earthquakes around the world that occurred in the last seven days.  By leveraging GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website and retrieving that data using JavaScript, D3 and Leaflet libraries, and Mapbox to display our map, we were able to provide the DRN a website that plots these earthquakes over several map overlays and show the location of the Earth's tectonic plates.
